					<span class="first-char">J</span>ava is a set of several computer software and specifications 
developed by Sun Microsystems, later acquired by Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software 
and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded 
devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. While less common, Java applets run in secure, sandboxed 
environments to provide many features of native applications and can be embedded in HTML pages.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
					<span class="first-char">W</span>riting in the Java programming language is the primary way to 
produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM); byte code compilers are also available for other 
languages, including Ada, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. In addition, several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM,
 including Scala, Clojure and Groovy. Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++, but object-oriented features are modeled after 
Smalltalk and Objective-C.Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where every 
object is allocated on the heap and all variables of object types are references. Memory management is handled through integrated 
automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM.

					implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

					<span class="first-char">.NET</span> Framework (pronounced dot net) is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
					<span class="first-char">FCL</span> provides user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their own source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. .NET Framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment largely for .NET software called Visual Studio.
